Version 1.2 (for Joomla 1.5.x)
January 2012
By Dave Ludwigsen and RSGallery2 Team

Displays a rudimentary tab with RSGallery2 information. This 
alpha release contains a listing of all galleries the user 
has owns and that are published with a random image for the thumbnail. If the 
user is in his or her own gallery, it also displays a link to 
edit his or her own galleries. There are currently no 
parameters.
