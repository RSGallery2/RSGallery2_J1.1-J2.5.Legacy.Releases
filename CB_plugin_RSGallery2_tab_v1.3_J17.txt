Version 1.3 (for Joomla 1.7.x)
9 January 2012
By Dave Ludwigsen and RSGallery2 Team

Displays a tab with RSGallery2 galleries on the Community 
Builder User profile. This tab contains a list of all 
published galleries owned by the user with either a random 
image for the thumbnail or the thumbnail that is assigned 
to the gallery. If My Galleries is enabled in the 
RSGallery2 configuration a link to edit his or her own 
galleries is displayed. There are currently no parameters. 
(Note: Since there is no way to detect the proper 
RSGallery2 menu item, because there can be many of them, 
the CB User profile menu item is used in the breadcrumb 
trail.)

Tested with
- Joomla 1.7.3
- RSGallery2 3.0.1
- Community Builder 1.7.1

Install
- Download the zip file
- Backend > Community Builder > Plugin Management
- Click: Install Plugin
- Select your downloaded package file at Package File and 
click Upload & Install (or use one the the other ways on 
this page to install)
- A success message should appear. Read the description 
text and click Continue
- Publish the RSGallery2 plugin

A logged in fronted user will see an extra tab besides 
"Contact Info" called "My Galleries". On this tab the 
galleries are shown that the user owns. When My Galleries 
is enabled in RSGallery2 a link to My Galleries will be 
shown as well.
